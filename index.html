                <b>data types:</b> The data types included in this visualization include attribute (categorical) and item. 
                The data is not specified, but the data within the pie charts is grouped into distinct caetgories,
                which is what is being measured at different quantities that are represented
                as portions on the pie charts. Each pie chart itself is an item on the visualization. <br/><br/>
                <b>marks:</b> The marks in this visualization include: points (each pie chart on the graph, item),
                 areas (each proportion of the pie chart, item) <br/><br/>
                <b>channels:</b> The channels included in this visualization include 
                Position: (each pie chart on the graph is in a distinct place), 
                Area (the amount of area that is shaded in each pie chart), 
                Color (each section of the pie chart), and Tilt (the angle that the pie charts divide their
                sections as).<br/><br/>

                <b>data types:</b> The data types included in this visualization
                include items, links, categories  and attributes. The items are the noted
                by the numbers on the left (1,2,3,4,5) and the attributes (categorical) are each point 
                for each item at each year. The categories are noted by the letters (A,B,C,D,E) 
                and represeny a category that is the state of the items at a certain time.
                The links are the lines that connect the points, indicating that each point 
                connected by the line is the same attribute for an item at a different time. <br/><br/>
                <b>marks:</b> The marks included are points (node), lines (link). The lines connect the 
                points together.  <br/><br/>
                <b>channels:</b> The channels include Position (where each point is on the visualization
                represents the status of it) and Color (when multiple points are the same color and
                are connected to each other by a line that is the same color, it indicates that
                that they are the same point at different levels at different years.)    <br/><br/>

            <p class="text-padding"> 
                <b>data types:</b> attributes (theme, category, idea). The data is not specified, but based on their
                general categories it would make sense that these attributes would be categorical since there are ideas that
                stem from themes/categories, categories that stem from themes, and themes that start off the mind map. There
                are also links (the lines between attributes) that specify the relationship between each attribute.<br/><br/>
                <b>marks:</b> There are points (used as nodes) for the themes, categories, and ideas. There are also
                connection marks that are represented by the links between nodes.<br/><br/>
                <b>channels:</b> The positions are both horizontal and vertical based on the location of each attribute.
                The colors used range from different shades of red to dark blue. The theme attribute is dark blue
                and the ideas and categories are different shades of red, likely dependent on what types of ideas/categories they are.
                Additionally, all of the connections between nodes are black. The shapes are ovals for the nodes with no tilt and lines for the
                connections between nodes with some tilt in order to connect the nodes. The area of all the nodes are the same, but
                the length of the lines is dependent on the distance from node to node.<br/><br/>

            <p class="text-padding"> 
                <b>data types:</b> Since the data is not specified, but each bar is grouped
                into a category, it would make sense that the categories would be categorical attributes (levels: A, B, C, D). Additionally,
                the subcategories that are highlighted by different colors should be categorial attributes as well (levels: 
                red-orange, red, dark red, dark blue)
                Addtionally, there is some quantitative unspecified ordered attribute that has ordered levels from 0 - 1000.<br/><br/>
                <b>marks:</b> The marks are areas with a fixed width for the attributes (A, B, C, D) and a height from ranges 0 - 1000 depending
                on the quantitative unspecified ordered attribute. These marks are used as nodes.<br/><br/>
                <b>channels:</b> The position of the channels is vertical for each stacked bar, horizontal for the way each bar is
                lined up next to the other. For colors, each stack in the column is a different shades of red or one shade of dark blue
                on the bottom stacks. The shapes are all rectangles that have no tilt and the size of
                each bar is the area of the height (range 0 - 100) and the width (fixed value for each attribute). Additionally,
                each rectangle is based on the amount of each smaller category.<br/><br/>
