                <b>data types:</b> The data types included in this visualization include attribute (categorical, quantatative) and item. 
                The data is not specified, but the data within the pie charts is split based on a quantatative, ordered percentage attribute with levels from 0-100%.
                Additionally, each pie chart represents an attribute that can be split via percentages.
                Each pie chart itself is an item on the visualization. There are also three other instances of quantatative,
                ordered data along the x and y axes that determines the position of the pie charts on the graph (levels: 0-1000 for the y-axis and
                0-10 for the x-axis), and a quantatative attribute that determines the size of each bubble marker (levels: size in relation to a given parameter).<br/><br/>
                <b>marks:</b> The marks in this visualization include: points (each pie chart on the graph is an item/node),
                 areas (each proportion of the pie chart, and the size of each bubble marker) <br/><br/>
                <b>channels:</b> The channels of this compound bubble and pie chart control the appearance of the marks mentioned above with position,
                color, shape, tilt, and size. The position of the marks are both horizontal and vertical and determined by the quantatative, ordered data
                along the x and y axes. The color of each section of the pie chart is determined based on the distinct categories within each pie chart.
                Additionally, all of the pie charts are circular, but there are different sizes for each bubble marker which is determined by a
                a quantatative attribute. Each section of each pie chart has a different level of tilt depending on each location as well.
                As stated before, the size of each pie chart (area) is determined by a quantatative attribute and the size of each
                section is determined by a quantatative % attribute.

                <b>data types:</b> The data types included in this visualization
                are links and attributes. The ordinal attributes are noted
                by the numbers on the left (levels: 1,2,3,4,5) and the attributes (categorical) are each point 
                for each item at each year (the year attributes have levels from 2005, 2015, 2015, 2015).
                The categories are noted by the letters (levels: A,B,C,D,E) 
                and represent a category that is the state of the items at a certain time.
                The links are the lines that connect the points, indicating that each point 
                connected by the line is the same attribute for an item at a different time. 
                Additionally, there is a categorical attribute that sorts each point into different groups of four nodes
                and affects the color channel of each point. This attribute represents the change in rank over time.<br/><br/>
                <b>marks:</b> The marks included are points (node), lines (link). The lines connect the 
                points together based on their relationship to one another.<br/><br/>
                <b>channels:</b>
                The channels of this bump chart control the appearance of the marks mentioned above with position,
                color, shape, tilt, and size. The position of each node is both horizontal and vertical based on the
                rank attributes (A, B, C, D, E, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 2005, 2015, 2015, 2015) and is formatted in a grid-like
                fashion where there is a node that corresponds with each x and y-axis attribute. The colors of each node
                are determined based on an unspecified attribute which groups various nodes into categories (i.e. red-orange,
                dark blue, and dark red). Each set of four connected nodes all have the same colored nodes and links within
                their group. All of the nodes are circles and all of the links are lines to easily display the changes in rank
                over time. Additionally, the tilt of the nodes are none and the tilt of the links are based on each node's connection
                to another node. The size of all the nodes are uniform and the length of each link is based on the distance from
                one node to another.<br/><br/>

            <p class="text-padding"> 
                <b>data types:</b> The attributes include theme, category, idea. The data is not specified, but based on their
                general categories it would make sense that these attributes would be categorical since there are ideas that
                stem from themes/categories, categories that stem from themes, and themes that start off the mind map. There
                are also links (the lines between attributes) that specify the relationship between each attribute. Additionally,
                another potential categorical attribute could sort different ideas based on common categories.<br/><br/>
                <b>marks:</b> There are points (used as nodes) for the themes, categories, and ideas. There are also
                connection marks that are represented by the links between nodes.<br/><br/>
                <b>channels:</b> The channels of this mind map control the appearance of the marks mentioned above with position,
                color, shape, tilt, and size. The positions of the nodes are both horizontal and vertical based on the location of each attribute,
                since each concept stems from another, the positions of nodes must be relative to other similar nodes. Additionally, the positions of the
                links are determined based on which concepts relate to others.
                The colors used range from different shades of red to dark blue based on whether the node is a theme, idea, or category. The theme attribute is dark blue
                and the ideas and categories are different shades of red, likely dependent on what types of ideas/categories they are.
                Additionally, all of the connections between nodes are dark blue. The shapes of the nodes are ovals with no tilt and lines for the
                connections between nodes with some tilt in order to connect the correct nodes. The area of all the nodes are the same, but
                the length of the lines is dependent on the distance from node to node.<br/><br/>

                <b>data types:</b> Since the data is not specified, but each bar is grouped
                into a category, it would make sense that the larger categories would be categorical attributes (levels: A, B, C, D). Additionally,
                the subcategories that are highlighted by different colors should be categorial attributes as well (levels: 
                red-orange, red, dark red, dark blue). There is also an unspecified quantitative ordered attribute that has ordered levels from 0 - 1000
                and represents a total amount of something.<br/><br/>
                <b>marks:</b> The marks for each subcategory are areas with a fixed width for the attributes (A, B, C, D) and a height from ranges 0 - 1000 depending
                on the quantitative unspecified ordered attribute. These marks are used as nodes. The overall bar chart for main categories also
                has a fixed width and a height dependent of the unspecified quantitative ordered attribute (levels: 0-1000) and is a node.<br/><br/>
                <b>channels:</b> The channels of this stacked bar chart control the appearance of the marks mentioned above with position,
                color, shape, tilt, and size. The position of the subcategory and main category nodes are vertical for each stacked bar, horizontal for the way each main category bar is
                lined up next to the other. For colors, each stack in the column is a different shade of red or one shade of dark blue
                on the bottom stacks in order to distinguish the subcategories within each main category. The shapes of the subcategory and main category nodes are all rectangles that have no tilt and the size of
                each bar is the area of the height (range 0 - 100) and the width (fixed value for each attribute). Additionally,
                the size of the category bar is based on the total area of each subcategory.<br/><br/>
